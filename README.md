# Stolon

Reusable AI skills that extend from one domain to another — like stolons in nature.

## Skills

| Name | Reference | Trigger |
|------|-----------|---------|
| [c-project-init](skills/c-project-init/) | setup.md | Scaffold a new C project |
| [c-project-build](skills/c-project-build/) | build.md | Build, test, sanitizer, coverage |
| [c-project-debug](skills/c-project-debug/) | debug.md | Crash, segfault, hang investigation |
| [c-project-commit](skills/c-project-commit/) | commit.md | Stage, commit, push |
| [c-project-style](skills/c-project-style/) | style.md | Write or review .c/.h files |

## Architecture

Each SKILL.md is a thin gate — three sections only:

1. **description** (YAML frontmatter) — CSO trigger keywords for skill discovery
2. **When NOT to Use** — cross-references to sibling skills for routing
3. **STOP** — forces the agent to locate and `readFile` the heavy reference (`references/*.md`) before any action

All domain knowledge lives in the reference files, not in SKILL.md. This keeps SKILL.md under 200 tokens while the references can be 600+ lines.

## Usage

Copy `skills/` into your agent's skill directory (e.g. `~/.kiro/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/`). Skills are self-contained and independent of each other.
